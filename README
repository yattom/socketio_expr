Experiment for socket.io with JavaScript and Python.

The aim is to stress both server and client to see how it behaves under heavy traffic.
A msg sent from a client will be broadcasted to all connected clients.

Server is written with flask-socket.io.  Client app is written with socket.io.
There is also client web app on server.

To start server:
% pipenv install
% pipenv run python -m app.__init__

To run client app:
% npm install socket.io-client
% node main.js

To access client web app:
1. start server
2. access / (i.e. http://localhost:5000)
